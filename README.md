* F﻿lask
* P﻿ython
* P﻿ublic Speaking

## **Contribution**

[Simon](https://github.com/sim1029)﻿ and [Harry](https://github.com/Harry-Schlechter) created the React Native shell for our project that communicated with our Flask API. [Trevor](https://github.com/tpetersen4) and [Maya](https://github.com/alidiusk) deployed the Flask API. We all presented the final project to the judges at Steelhacks.

## **Outcome**

F﻿irst place project in the beginner track

## **Key Takeaways**

T﻿rying to build a generalized application which will work accross platforms is difficult and often times will lead to a mediocre experience on each platform. Creating best in class native versions of software when possible is more ideal. Get something working well for a single platform before trying to include each device out there (Android, iPhone, Laptop, TV...)
